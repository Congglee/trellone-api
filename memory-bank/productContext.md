# TrellOne API - Product Context

## Why TrellOne Exists

TrellOne addresses the need for a modern, flexible project management solution that combines the simplicity of Kanban boards with real-time collaboration capabilities. It provides teams with an intuitive way to organize work, track progress, and collaborate seamlessly.

## Problems It Solves

### 1. Project Organization Chaos

- **Problem**: Teams struggle with scattered tasks, unclear priorities, and lack of visual workflow
- **Solution**: Kanban-style boards with customizable columns that reflect actual workflow stages
- **Value**: Clear visual representation of work progress and bottlenecks

### 2. Poor Team Collaboration

- **Problem**: Team members work in silos, lack real-time updates, and miss important changes
- **Solution**: Real-time updates, instant notifications, and collaborative editing
- **Value**: Enhanced team synchronization and reduced communication overhead

### 3. Complex Tool Onboarding

- **Problem**: Existing tools are either too simple or overly complex for most teams
- **Solution**: Intuitive interface with progressive disclosure of advanced features
- **Value**: Quick adoption with room for growth

### 4. Limited Customization

- **Problem**: One-size-fits-all solutions don't adapt to unique team workflows
- **Solution**: Flexible board structures, custom fields, and adaptable workflows
- **Value**: Tool adapts to team needs, not vice versa
