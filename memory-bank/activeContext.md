1. **Immediate Production Deployment** with enhanced organizational hierarchy
2. **Continued Feature Development** with solid workspace foundation
3. **Team Scaling** with established patterns and comprehensive feature set

**Key Enhancement**: The addition of workspaces creates a more scalable organizational structure (Workspaces â†’ Boards â†’ Columns â†’ Cards) that better serves enterprise and team collaboration needs.

The immediate focus should be on **API documentation** and **testing infrastructure** to support production deployment and team scaling, rather than core functionality development.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with production deployment preparation while building documentation and testing infrastructure in parallel, highlighting the enhanced workspace functionality as a key differentiator.
