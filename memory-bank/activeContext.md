- [ ] Add end-to-end testing for critical workflows
- [ ] Set up continuous integration testing

### 3. Production Deployment Preparation

**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Status**: Infrastructure enhancements for production

**Actions Needed**:

- [ ] Create production environment configuration
- [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware

## Summary

TrellOne API is currently in a **stable, production-ready state** with all core functionality implemented and operational. The clean git status reflects successful completion of development cycles, and the project is well-positioned for either:

1. **Immediate Production Deployment** with current feature set
2. **Continued Feature Development** with solid foundation
3. **Team Scaling** with established patterns and documentation

The immediate focus should be on **API documentation** and **testing infrastructure** to support production deployment and team scaling, rather than core functionality development.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with production deployment preparation while building documentation and testing infrastructure in parallel.
